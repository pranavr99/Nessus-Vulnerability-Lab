# Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the essential components of vulnerability management, focusing on vulnerability scanning, remediation, and verification. These stages are crucial elements of the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle, aimed at bolstering system security.

## Tools Used

- **Windows ISO 2019 Server:** Operating system for hosting vulnerable virtual machines.
- **DigitalOcean:** Cloud hosting provider used for deploying virtual machines.
- **Nessus Essentials:** Primary tool for vulnerability scanning.
- **Firefox 3.6.12:** Example application to demonstrate vulnerabilities.
- **Termius:** Remote SSH client for managing virtual machines.
- **VNC Viewer:** Utilized for remote desktop access to virtual machines.

## Vulnerability Scanning

Using Nessus Essentials, credentialed scans are conducted on the virtual machines hosted on DigitalOcean. These scans identify potential security weaknesses within the system's architecture.

## Remediation (Excluded)

## Verification

After scanning, the effectiveness of the vulnerability remediation efforts is validated through thorough rescans. This verification step ensures the reliability and accuracy of the vulnerability assessment.

## Conclusion

This project provides a hands-on exploration of vulnerability management, emphasizing proactive security measures. Through the utilization of various tools and systematic approaches, we refine our skills in identifying and mitigating potential threats, ultimately enhancing our cybersecurity posture.
